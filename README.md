## Overview

ECDSA is widely used in various cryptographic systems, but its security hinges on the proper generation of random nonces. If nonces (`k` values) are reused or are too similar across different signatures, it becomes possible to recover the private key using certain mathematical techniques.

### Mathematical Foundation

This attack leverages the **Lattice Reduction** technique, specifically the **LLL Algorithm** (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov√°sz). The core idea is to construct a lattice from multiple ECDSA signatures. Through lattice reduction, we can uncover relationships between these signatures that ultimately reveal the private key.

### Attack Workflow

1. **Input Data**: The attack requires pairs of ECDSA signatures (`r`, `s`) and their corresponding message hashes (`z`).
2. **Matrix Construction**: We construct a matrix based on these signatures, which captures the underlying structure of the ECDSA equations.
3. **LLL Reduction**: The matrix is reduced using the LLL algorithm, transforming it into a form that makes it easier to extract potential private keys.
4. **Private Key Recovery**: Potential private keys are derived from the reduced matrix and checked against the original signatures.
